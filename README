1. eMake - added Jan 29 2012

#title : eMake (e = easy as in easyMake)

#Problem : 
	cmake only allows for one "CMakeList.txt" per folder. 
	there is no equivalent to "make -f myproject.c"

#Solution :
	save the cmake file as "CMakeList.myproject"
	the script renames the file to "CMakeLists.txt",
	performs the cmake & make commands and
	renames "CMakeLists.txt" to "CMakeLists.myproject"

#Steps : 
	mv ../CMakeLists.myproject ../CMakeLists.txt
	cmake .. 
	make
	mv ../CMakeLists.txt ../CMakeLists.myproject

#Setup* :
	create a "build" folder for the project
	save eMake in this folder 

#Execute :
       call eMake with the argument "myproject"
       ./eMake myproject

*alternateively save eMake in /usr/local/bin.
within the "build" folder execute : eMake myproject
